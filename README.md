# Welcome to react-animations ðŸš§

Thanks for getting involved with react-animations development,

This project is very new and not even on NPM yet. If you're curious where it's headed, here is an [early peek at the documentation](https://dist-rfcbmksupd.now.sh/).

## Getting Started

This project uses

- [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage multiple libs
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for a great development experience
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for painless testing.

Before doing anything else, run these commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:hanford/react-animations.git
cd react-animations
yarn install
yarn bootstrap
yarn build
```

## Root Repo Scripts:

```sh
yarn bootstrap    # bootstraps lerna so all dependencies get
                  # linked for cross-component development

yarn start        # starts storybook server

yarn test         # runs tests in all packages

yarn build        # builds all packages

yarn release      # publishes changed packages
```

## Running / Writing Examples

First do the steps in "Getting started", then start the Storybook server:

```
yarn start
```

Next, put a file in `packages/<component-dir>/examples/<name>.example.js` and make it look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";

// The name of the example, you must export it as `name`
export let name = "Basic";

// The example to render, you must name it `Example`
export let Example = () => <div>Cool cool cool</div>;
```

Now you can edit the files in `packages/*` and storybook will automatically reload your changes.

**Note**: If you change an internal dependency you will need to run `yarn build` again. For example, if working on `MenuButton` requires a change to `Rect` (an internal dependency of `MenuButton`), you will need to run `yarn build` for the changes to `Rect` to show up in your `MenuButton` example.

## Running / Writing Tests

First do the steps in "Getting Started", then:

```
yarn test
```

Or if you want to run the tests as you edit files:

```
yarn test --watch
```

Often you'll want to just test the component you're working on:

```
cd packages/<component-path>
yarn test --watch
```
